# hotreload

An implementation of a basic counter "hello world" with automatic hot code reloading implemented for the update module.

run `make debug` to start the project and `make watch` to enable automatic recompilation.

simply make a change in the `src/hotreload/update.gleam` file and the browser should automatically apply it without any further interaction.
